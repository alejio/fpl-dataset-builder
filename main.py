    This command fetches the latest FPL data and updates the database:
    - Bootstrap data (players, teams, prices, form) - ALWAYS refreshed
    - Availability snapshot - AUTOMATICALLY captured for current/next GW
    - Current gameweek data - Only if missing (use --force-refresh-gameweek to update)
    - Derived analytics - ALWAYS reprocessed from fresh raw data

    The snapshot is automatically captured based on gameweek state:
    - If GW not finished: Captures snapshot for current GW (before deadline)
    - If GW finished: Captures snapshot for next GW (for upcoming deadline)

    Common workflows:

    1. After gameweek finishes (capture results):
       uv run main.py main

    2. Before next gameweek starts (refresh everything):
       uv run main.py main --force-refresh-gameweek

    3. Quick price/form update (fastest):

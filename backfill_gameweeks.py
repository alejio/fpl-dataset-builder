Backfill Missing Gameweek Data Script

This script identifies and fills missing gameweek data by fetching from the FPL API.
Captures all gameweek-specific data including:
- Player performance data (raw_player_gameweek_performance)
- Manager picks data (raw_my_picks)

Useful for:
- Capturing gameweek 1 data that was missed during development
- Filling gaps if the main pipeline was skipped during any gameweek
- One-time historical data recovery for complete season analysis

Usage:
    # Backfill all missing gameweeks up to current
    uv run python backfill_gameweeks.py

    # Backfill specific gameweek
    uv run python backfill_gameweeks.py --gameweek 1

    # Backfill range of gameweeks
    uv run python backfill_gameweeks.py --start-gw 1 --end-gw 5

    # Backfill with different manager ID
    uv run python backfill_gameweeks.py --manager-id 12345

    # Dry run to see what would be backfilled
    uv run python backfill_gameweeks.py --dry-run
